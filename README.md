✅ Day 8 — Auto Furniture Placement (Auto-Layout Furnishing)

✔ Completed

What I added

Auto furniture placement engine that places simple, scalable furniture inside rooms based on room geometry (no ML — deterministic rules).

Furniture types (per room):

Living: sofa, coffee table, TV unit

Bedroom: bed, pillow, wardrobe (if space)

Kitchen: counter + sink

Bathroom: toilet + basin

Furniture rendered as SVG elements inside the same plan (included in SVG/PNG exports).

Show / Hide Furniture toggle in SvgCanvas for quick UI control.

Safe fallback: furniture rendering is wrapped in try/catch so it never breaks the plan rendering.

Files added / modified

Added: src/utils/furnitureEngine.js — placement logic + SVG generator

Modified: src/components/SvgCanvas.jsx — integrates furniture engine, adds toggle, keeps zoom & export features

Modified: src/styles.css — furniture visual styles


🏆 Day 9 — PDF Export (Vector + PNG Fallback)

✔ Completed

This is a major professional feature — perfect for architects, clients, and portfolio usage.

🔥 What we built today

Added Download PDF button inside SvgCanvas

Vector-quality export using jsPDF + svg2pdf.js

Rooms

Text

Furniture

Strokes
All preserved as vector paths (super clean at any zoom).

If vector export fails → automatic PNG fallback

Renders SVG → Canvas → PNG → embeds in PDF

Ensures PDF download always works, even on Windows / Chrome quirks

🧪 Additional features

Auto inline computed styles for better PDF fidelity

PDF page size automatically matches layout size

Clean filename generation based on width × height

📄 Updated Files

SvgCanvas.jsx (major update)

PDF export logic added

Cleaned imports to avoid bundler errors

⭐ Outcome

Users can now export high-quality PDFs of their generated layouts — ideal for sharing, printing, or professional submissions.

Large rooms receive multiple windows for realism

No overlap issues — openings stay on wall boundaries

Works together with furniture + room editor

🎯 Outcome
Users now see practical architectural elements — the plan looks like a real house blueprint, not just rectangles.


✅ Day 14 — Smart, Door-Aware Furniture Placement (Polished Layout Logic)
✔ Completed

- Upgraded `furnitureEngine` to use **doors + windows info** from `generateOpenings()`
- Furniture is now placed **more realistically**, instead of random blocks:
  - **Bedroom**
    - Bed headboard prefers solid walls (avoids door/window walls where possible)
    - Wardrobe tries to go on the opposite wall of the bed or a free wall
  - **Living Room**
    - Sofa is placed opposite the entry wall (from door), with a clear facing direction
    - Coffee table auto-aligns in front of the sofa (based on sofa facing)
    - TV unit tries to align opposite the sofa, centered on its wall
  - **Kitchen**
    - Counter runs along a window wall when available (more natural light)
    - Sink tries to sit under / near the window for a realistic layout
  - **Bathroom**
    - Toilet and basin placed in stable corners, keeping clear walking area

- Added small internal helpers:
  - `groupByRoom()` → groups door/window openings by room
  - `oppositeWall()` → helps align sofa vs TV vs entry
  - Used door/window walls to build a **blockedWalls** set → avoids placing big furniture on those walls

- Furniture SVG now has:
  - Better colors and subtle strokes (bed, sofa, wardrobe, TV, counter, sink, toilet, basin)
  - Sofa includes a **direction arrow** showing which way it faces

- Updated `SvgCanvas.jsx`:
  - Now calls `placeFurniture(layout, openings, spec)` instead of plain `placeFurniture(layout)`
  - Openings (doors & windows) are shared with the furniture engine, so furniture respects them

⭐ Outcome

Furniture layout now feels **intentional and realistic**, not random:
beds don’t block doors, sofas face into the room, TVs are on the correct wall,
kitchen sinks sit under windows — the whole floor plan looks like a real architect quickly drafted it.




🚀 Day 15 — Measurement Tool + Visual Distance Indicators

Room resizing also respects construction grid

📐 Developer-ready improvements for dimension alignment

🎯 Why this matters?
Before	After
Rooms move freely → messy alignment	Architects-style perfect alignment
Hard to reproduce precise sizes	Repeatable, measurable accurate shapes
Visually floating rooms	Grounded on logical grid foundation

This update pushes the tool toward REAL construction planning — not just a toy layout generator.

💡 Tech Changes

Updated SvgCanvas.jsx

Grid drawn before rooms using <pattern> SVG

Movement / resize remains quantized to 5px grid

🧪 How to Use
